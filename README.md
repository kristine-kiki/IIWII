## The Headeer
Company`s logo is at the top of the page what sets the main colour code for the page-black, golden orange and cream colour.

## Navigation Bar
Navigation Bar is under the Logo with shadowing effect, what makes it a good user`s experience. On larger screens they lines up, but on mobile devices they lines verticaly one under the other.
