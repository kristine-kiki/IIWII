## Deployment
Web page was created by using Github.Created new repository as per instructions. Repository "Good Street" after changed to "IIWII".That is because I changed the project. I was using "git add . " for adding the files and "git commit -m" to commit changes i was making, "git push" was used to push changes to repository on Github.

## Deployment to Github pages

Github repository-Settings-Branch-chainged to "main"-Saved. System provided live link to [IIWII](https://kristine-kiki.github.io/IIWII).

## Wireframes
Unfortunately I did not use Wireframes as I did not know about them. I was drafting web page layout in my notebook. At the beggining it helped, but with chaping the project I faced difficulties. About Balsamiq I learned just on the day i needed to submit my project. Absolutely will use it in the future.
